            <p>I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don’t know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don’t know how to do it. George. George. Weight has nothing to do with it. I know, and all I could say is I’m sorry. I can’t believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could’ve been killed.</p>
            <p>Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don’t want her to worry about you. You okay, is everything alright? Can’t be. This is nuts. Aw, c’mon. I’m too loud. I can’t believe it. I’m never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.</p>
            <p>Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother’s hair. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn’t run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Biff. I will. Oh.</p>
            <p>Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Ohh, no. There’s that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth’s gravitational pull? What a nightmare. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I’ll throw the rope down to you.</p>
            <p>Science Fiction Theater. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I’m wearing? Aw yeah, everything is great. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.</p>
